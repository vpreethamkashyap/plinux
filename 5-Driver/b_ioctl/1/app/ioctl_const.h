	1. type or magic number (type)
	2. sequence number which is eigth bits wide. This means
	   we can have up to 256 ioctl commands (nr)
	3. direction if the arg is involved, whether we are reading or writing 
	4. size(composition) of the arguement.
	   
   To arrive at unique numbers easily we use the following macros
   _IO(type, nr);
   _IOW(type, nr, dataitem) the fourth item calculated using sizeof 
   _IOR(type, nr, dataitem)
   _IOWR(type, nr, dataitem)
